For the reformer has enemies in all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all those who would profit by the new order, this Luke warmness arising partly from fear of their adversaries and partly from the incredulity of mankind, who do not truly believe in anything new until they have had actual experience of it.”—Niccolo Machiavelli (1513 AD)\n",
    "Many of yesterday’s giant, highly successful organizations such as DEC, NEC, Motorola, AT&T and many others do not exist anymore or are fading away at a steady pace. The common thread of problems with all of them are\n",
    "As companies become successful, they are forced to focus on operational excellence leading to a predominantly operational culture. They confuse operational excellence with entrepreneurial excellence and it becomes nearly impossible for them to return to the innovative and strategic cultures of the past. The organizations lose track of who they are, how to effectively communicate among all the stakeholders and build a culture that continually monitor and tune the strategy to the organizational traits that made them successful to begin with\n",
    "This theme is also the basic premise of the acclaimed book Innovators’ Dilemma where the author successfully argues that the very reason that make the organizations successful, are gradually forgotten and become the reasons of their eventual failure. The last few decades have seen the steady increase in the recognition that Knowledge about the organization, internal and external is one of the most valuable assets of any organization, but only a small part of the leadership and the managers believe and are sure of how to use this Organizational Knowledge.\n",
    "This brings us to questions such as \n",
    "What is Organizational Knowledge, aka Organizational Intelligence or Organizational Intelligent Quotient (OIQ), analogous to IQ of an individual? \n",
    "How does an organization measure, monitor and tune the collective intelligence (OIQ) of the overall organization?\n",
    "Organizational Intelligence or the OIQ is the capacity of an organization to create knowledge and use it to strategically adapt to its environment or marketplace. It is similar to IQ, but framed at an organizational level. Some researchers in the area of Organizational Intelligence have attempted to create a framework which provides organization a set of metrics which they can use to continuously measure, monitor and use these metrics to expand their overall organizational knowledge base and take strategic actions to keep the organization on the path of success. One of these frameworks is shown below\n",

    "needs to create alignment among the stakeholder, both external and internal\n",
    "needs a culture of open communication and information flow\n",
    "needs outside-in (customer first) strategy\n",
    "needs disciplined, fact-based decision making\n",
    "An important follow-up question is: how does an organization measure itself and all its constituent stakeholders on these metrics in concrete numbers (not just a set of qualitative statements or wish list) and create a set of actionable facts to drive its value creation strategy?\"\"\""

    "source_1 = \"A server is a device that communicates with other computers known as clients. It provides resources for powering services across a network. These include data processing and running applications.\\nThe history of servers dates back to the 1980s. At that time, organizations used them to store information securely. In the 1990s, however, this technology became a vital part of the internet. It now powers websites, remote databases, cloud computing, and more.\"\n",
    "source_2 = \"A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network. In theory, whenever computers share resources with client machines they are considered servers. There are many types of servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.\\nAn individual system can provide resources and use them from another system at the same time. This means that a device could be both a server and a client at the same time.\\nSome of the first servers were mainframe computers or minicomputers. Minicomputers were much smaller than mainframe computers, hence the name. However, as technology progressed, they ended up becoming much larger than desktop computers, which made the term microcomputer somewhat farcical.\\nInitially, such servers were connected to clients known as terminals that did not do any actual computing. These terminals, referred to as dumb terminals, existed simply to accept input via a keyboard or card reader and to return the results of any computations to a display screen or printer. The actual computing was done on the server.\\nLater, servers were often single, powerful computers connected over a network to a set of less-powerful client computers. This network architecture is often referred to as the client-server model, in which both the client computer and the server possess computing power, but certain tasks are delegated to servers. In previous computing models, such as the mainframe-terminal model, the mainframe did act as a server even though it wasn’t referred to by that name.\\nAs technology has evolved, the definition of a server has evolved with it. These days, a server may be nothing more than software running on one or more physical computing devices. Such servers are often referred to as virtual servers. Originally, virtual servers were used to increase the number of server functions a single hardware server could do. Today, virtual servers are often run by a third-party on hardware across the Internet in an arrangement called cloud computing.\\nA server may be designed to do a single task, such as a mail server, which accepts and stores email and then provides it to a requesting client. Servers may also perform several tasks, such as a file and print server, which both stores files and accepts print jobs from clients and then sends them on to a network-attached printer.\"\n",
    "source_3 = \"A server is a computer that provides data to other computers. It may serve data to systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the Internet.\\nMany types of servers exist, including web servers, mail servers, and file servers. Each type runs software specific to the purpose of the server. For example, a Web server may run Apache HTTP Server or Microsoft IIS, which both provide access to websites over the Internet. A mail server may run a program like Exim or iMail, which provides SMTP services for sending and receiving email. A file server might use Samba or the operating system's built-in file sharing services to share files over a network.\\nWhile server software is specific to the type of server, the hardware is not as important. In fact, a regular desktop computers can be turned into a server by adding the appropriate software. For example, a computer connected to a home network can be designated as a file server, print server, or both.\\nWhile any computer can be configured as a server, most large businesses use rack-mountable hardware designed specifically for server functionality. These systems, often 1U in size, take up minimal space and often have useful features such as LED status lights and hot-swappable hard drive bays. Multiple rack-mountable servers can be placed in a single rack and often share the same monitor and input devices. Most servers are accessed remotely using remote access software, so input devices are often not even necessary.\\nWhile servers can run on different types of computers, it is important that the hardware is sufficient to support the demands of the server. For instance, a web server that runs lots of web scripts in real-time should have a fast processor and enough RAM to handle the \\\"load\\\" without slowing down. A file server should have one or more fast hard drives or SSDs that can read and write data quickly. Regardless of the type of server, a fast network connection is critical, since all data flows through that connection.\"\n",
    "source_4 = \"Web servers are software or hardware (or both together) that stores and delivers content to a web browser at a basic level. The servers communicate with browsers using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Web servers can also support SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol).\\nWeb servers are also used for hosting websites and data for web applications. They can host single websites and multiple websites using virtualization.\\nWhy is it important to understand the answer to the question, how does a web server work? The success of a website doesn’t just depend on its content and functionality but also the efficiency of the web server used to power it. This requires an understanding of a web server’s capabilities and limitations. When discussing how a Web server works, it is not enough to simply outline a diagram of how low-level network packets go in and out of a Web server.\\nYears ago, when Web servers were first prototyped, they served simple HTML documents and images. Today, as we shall go into later in this tutorial, they are frequently used for much more.\\nThe first step is to view the Web server as a black box and ask the questions: How does it work; what can it achieve? It’s a safe assumption that most Internet users believe a Web site’s success or failure is due to its content and functionality rather than the server used to power it. However, the choice of the correct server, and understanding its capabilities and limitations is an important step on the road to success.\"\n",
    "source_5 = \"A server is a type of computer on a network that manages shared and privileged resources and often plays dedicated roles and executes processing for a specific IT function for an organization. While a single computer can run several small processes simultaneously, servers are highly specialized computers responsible for managing particular resources for a network or IT environment.\\nWhile traditional servers are most visible as the physical appliances buzzing in rows of a data center, advancements in technology mean IT professionals can create virtual server instances with a hypervisor or pay for cloud server capabilities.\""
